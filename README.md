## Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch 🧠

This repository contains my **from-scratch implementations** of core Machine Learning algorithms using **Python**, developed and executed in **Jupyter Lab**, without relying on libraries like `scikit-learn` for the model logic.

The main purpose of this repo is **learning by doing** — understanding how machine learning algorithms work internally by implementing them step by step.

## 📌 Algorithms Implemented

### 1️⃣ Linear Regression
- Implemented using **Gradient Descent**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the cost function
- Manual weight and bias updates
- Basic visualizations in Jupyter Lab

### 2️⃣ Logistic Regression
- Binary classification
- Sigmoid activation function
- Binary Cross-Entropy loss
- Gradient Descent optimization

### 3️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Distance-based classification
- Euclidean distance calculation
- Majority voting
- Implemented without using sklearn

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Lab
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn

## 🎯 Learning Objective

I may not fully understand every concept yet, but implementing these algorithms from scratch helped me:
- Go beyond using pre-built libraries
- Build intuition for how ML models work internally
- Strengthen my fundamentals in Machine Learning

This repository represents my **learning journey and practice**, not just final outcomes.

---

## 🚀 What’s Next
- Improve mathematical understanding
- Add more visual explanations
- Compare results with sklearn implementations
- Implement more ML algorithms from scratch
